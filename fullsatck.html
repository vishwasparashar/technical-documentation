                    If there were a diagram of the duties that Back End Web Developers handle and the duties that front end developers handle, the duties of a Full Stack Web Developer would be the part where the two diagrams combined. Indeed, in many cases, there is quite a bit of overlap between Front End and Back End Developers. It‚Äôs important to know the duties of Front End Developers and Back End Developers so you can know the duties that a Full Stack Developer may need to swing in and assist with.

                      Front End Developers: - Deal with the interface and user-facing systems - Develop the navigation, interface, and visuals - Focus on user experience - Utilize HTML, CSS3, and JavaScript - Are the most aesthetically-forward web development position

                      Back End Developers: - Deal with the server and database of the application - Create the back frame that allows the front end development to exist - Utilize Python, Ruby, and PHP - Store user information into database

                      Full Stack Developers: - Cross-discipline web development skills involving front and back end - Deal with the overlap between the front end and back end - Utilize all the coding languages of the first two plus MySQL, machine learning, and more - Take responsibility for the entire experience to make sure it goes smoothly
