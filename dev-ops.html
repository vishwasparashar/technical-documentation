                <p class="content-txt">
                     
                   Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer ‚Äúsiloed.‚Äù Sometimes, these two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function.

                   In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams may also become more tightly integrated with development and operations and throughout the application lifecycle. When security is the focus of everyone on a DevOps team, this is sometimes referred to as DevSecOps.
                   These teams use practices to automate processes that historically have been manual and slow. They use a technology stack and tooling which help them operate and evolve applications quickly and reliably. These tools also help engineers independently accomplish tasks (for example, deploying code or provisioning infrastructure) that normally would have required help from other teams, and this further increases a team‚Äôs velocity.
                   <h4>benefits of dev-ops</h4>
                   <b>Speed</b> 
                   Move at high velocity so you can innovate for customers faster, adapt to changing markets better, and grow more efficient at driving business results. The DevOps model enables your developers and operations teams to achieve these results. For example, microservices and continuous delivery let teams take ownership of services and then release updates to them quicker.
                   <br>

                  <b>Rapid Delivery</b>
                   Increase the frequency and pace of releases so you can innovate and improve your product faster. The quicker you can release new features and fix bugs, the faster you can respond to your customers‚Äô needs and build competitive advantage. Continuous integration and continuous delivery are practices that automate the software release process, from build to deploy.
