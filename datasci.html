                    Data Science is a field that gives insights from structured and unstructured data, using different scientific methods and algorithms, and consequently helps in generating insights, making predictions and devising data driver solutions. It uses a large amount of data to get meaningful insights using statistics and computation for decision making.

                    The data used in Data Science is usually collected from different sources, such as e-commerce sites, surveys, social media, and internet searches. All this access to data has become possible due to the advanced technologies for data collection. This data helps in making predictions and providing profits to the businesses accordingly. Data Science is the most discussed topic in today‚Äôs time and is a hot career option due to the great opportunities it has to offer.
                    Let‚Äôs try to understand why we need Data Science. There are several reasons for the increasing demand for Data Science. All the sectors are opting for Data Science as it offers a great way to enhance the business. Below are the reasons why Data Science is important.
                    <h4>scope of data-science</h4>
                   Data Science plays an utmost role in the healthcare industry. With the help of patient‚Äôs data, predictions can be made, if a person can get infected by a certain disease in the future. Therefore, they can follow some precautions and save themselves from the disease. This has become possible because of Data Science as it can find the relation between different features responsible for causing a disease.
                   Data Science has played an essential role in the retail industry, also with the help of a recommendation system. Analyzing the shopping history of the customers, Data Science can get the set of products, which are bought by the customers together. Therefore, if any customer buys one or two products from that set, then he or she can be recommended with the other products in the set.
                   Data Science has proved its benefits for e-commerce sites as well. This is done based on the browsing history of the customers. As an example, if a customer has searched for a particular item, then he or she can be recommended with similar products.
